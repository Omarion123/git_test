        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Black-eyed pea patties made with bacon, shallots, and roasted red peppers are pan-fried until golden brown 
            and crispy.</p>
        <p>This recipe calls for canned peas, but for more flavor, I sometimes use leftover peas that I cooked with ham 
            hocks or smoked turkey from New Year's. Get creative with how you serve them</p>
        <h1>Ingredient</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound bacon</li>
            <li>3 cups canned black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped roasted red peppers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 
                about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Mash black-eyed peas in a bowl with a fork. Crumble bacon into the bowl, then stir in red peppers 
                and shallot. Stir in enough flour to make the mixture stick together. Season with salt and pepper 
                and form into four equal patties.</li>
            <li>Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter melts. Add patties 
                and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
